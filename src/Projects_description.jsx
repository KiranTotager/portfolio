      description:
        "A robust desktop application that uses real-time facial recognition and emotion detection to automate attendance. Built using Python and DeepFace for image recognition, the system also classifies emotional states like 'Happy', 'Sad', etc., with over 90% accuracy. Integrated with MySQL for secure attendance storage, with separate tables per day and role-based access to ensure admin control. Frontend handled with Tkinter for a clean UI experience.",

      description:
        "Built a secure authentication backend for internal tools at L&T using FastAPI and JWT. Users receive session-specific tokens upon login, which are then verified across protected API routes. Also built token/session verification utilities for reuse across services. Integrated aiomysql for efficient async MySQL queries, reducing query lag by 35%. Focused on secure and scalable API design, ensuring tokens expire after session end and canâ€™t be reused.",
