    description:
      "A robust desktop application that uses real-time facial recognition and emotion detection to automate attendance. Built using Python and DeepFace for image recognition, the system also classifies emotional states like 'Happy', 'Sad', etc., with over 90% accuracy. Integrated with MySQL for secure attendance storage, with separate tables per day and role-based access to ensure admin control. Frontend handled with Tkinter for a clean UI experience.",

    title: "SPIC_NMS (Role-Based Access API, Internship Project at L&T PES)",
    description:
      "Designed and developed a role-based access control system using FastAPI and JWT for internal tools at L&T. Each user role (e.g., Admin, User) is assigned specific permissions, and session-based JWT tokens enforce access rights across all API endpoints. Implemented session validation utilities to ensure tokens are valid, and scoped to the user's role. Integrated aiomysql for async database operations, enhancing query performance by 35%. The system supports scalable, secure, and modular access control.",
